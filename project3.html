    <p>
      Designed and optimized a habitable lunar rover for extended surface exploration as part of the NASA Moonshot Challenge, focusing on crew mobility, life support, power systems, and scientific instrumentation for long-duration missions. Created comprehensive CAD models of the rover chassis, six-wheel drivetrain, suspension, structural frames, and habitat modules, including integrated workspaces, laboratories, airlock systems, and storage for tools, supplies, and life support.
<br><br>
Engineered and evaluated system-level architectures for Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS), water-regolith separation, hydrogen fuel production, radioisotope–hydrogen power, and in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) through 3D-printed regolith tools and replacement components. Designed the rover to support a crew of 2–4 for missions ranging from 7 to 45 days, ensuring operational safety, environmental monitoring, and crew health management while traversing diverse lunar terrains.
<br><br>
Implemented science and exploration objectives, including atmospheric analysis, radiation monitoring, dust detection, lunar surface mapping, and analog testing for geologic hazards and navigational safety. The rover’s integrated sensor bay included seismometers, synthetic aperture radar, cameras, and temperature sensors to support data collection and real-time mission planning.
<br><br>
Iteratively refined rover designs, including wheel size and configuration, pressurized habitat layout, and power systems, transitioning from solar power to a reliable radioisotope–hydrogen system to address low-light conditions at the lunar south pole. Optimized spatial integration to fit the rover and supplies within lunar cargo constraints, while ensuring redundancy for emergency shelter capability.
<br><br>
The project emphasized mission-level trade studies, multidisciplinary systems engineering, and technical communication, including presentations to NASA engineers. This effort contributed to the team’s strategic planning, improved operational safety, and innovative rover design, demonstrating effective integration of habitat, mobility, and scientific subsystems for lunar exploration.</p>
