    <p>
      This project involved designing and optimizing a functional bridge using the West Point Bridge Designer software while meeting realistic constraints related to cost, strength, and durability. The objective was to produce a design that could withstand applied loads without exceeding the given budget.
<br><br>
The design process began with developing and testing multiple conceptual bridge designs to evaluate structural performance and cost efficiency. Features from the strongest designs were combined into a refined model, which was iteratively tested and adjusted through trial and error. This approach allowed for informed design decisions based on performance data rather than assumptions.
<br><br>
Through this activity, I gained insight into the complexity of structural design and load distribution. I developed a stronger understanding of member sizing, material selection, and when to use solid versus hollow members to balance strength and cost. The project also highlighted the importance of exploring unconventional designs; while my final bridge was effective, pushing beyond standard truss patterns could have led to a more innovative and cost-efficient solution.
