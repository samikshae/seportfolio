    <p>
      Designed, manufactured, and tested an electric vehicle as part of a multidisciplinary engineering project, optimizing for speed, torque, and weight constraints to meet competition specifications. Developed a dual-motor, dual-gearbox drivetrain delivering power directly to the axles, paired with custom wood wheels optimized for both velocity and torque. Iteratively refined chassis design through CAD modeling and prototyping, balancing theoretical performance with real-world constraints, including aerodynamics, weight limits, and manufacturability.
<br><br>
Engineered custom components, including laser-cut wheels, chassis reinforcements, and attachment brackets, to ensure structural integrity while adhering to strict dimensional and mass requirements. Conducted performance testing for pull force, traction, and speed, analyzing deviations between theoretical calculations and experimental results, and identifying sources of error such as unaccounted friction and wheel alignment. Adjusted design based on testing feedback to improve functionality and ensure compliance with competition guidelines.
<br><br>
This project strengthened practical skills in mechanical design, system integration, prototyping, and iterative testing, while emphasizing the importance of material selection, weight optimization, and performance evaluation in constrained engineering systems.
