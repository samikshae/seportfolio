    <p>
      This year-long independent research project investigated the use of shape memory alloys (SMAs) as an adaptive material for morphing aircraft wings with the goal of improving stability and reducing the negative effects of turbulence. The study focused on the potential of nickel-titanium (NiTi) SMAs to dynamically alter wing shape in response to external conditions, offering a novel alternative to conventional rigid wing structures.
<br><br>
The project explored the principles behind morphing wing technology and evaluated how SMAs can be integrated to reduce wing twist, vibration, and structural stress. By reviewing existing aerospace research and modeling wing behavior under turbulent conditions, the project analyzed how SMA-based actuation could improve torsional stiffness and mitigate instability while maintaining aerodynamic efficiency.
<br><br>
Through this work, I developed a strong understanding of smart materials, aerospace structural behavior, and the trade-offs involved in adaptive wing design. The project highlighted both the advantages and limitations of SMAs, including their responsiveness, durability concerns, and implementation challenges. Overall, the research demonstrated the potential of shape memory alloys to contribute to safer, more efficient, and more resilient aircraft designs in future aviation systems.</p>
